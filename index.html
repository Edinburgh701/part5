  <title>Passion projects/experiences, and some ideas I would like to persue in the near future.</title>

<body>
Bellow are some thoughts I have on personal projects/ideas I have in the near future and also some areas I belive I need to improve in:

As mentioned previously, I would like to start up my own club at UT, but before that I want to commit to some smaller comunity service orginisation, either on or off campus,
to get a better feel of different comunities and interests I might not be familiar with.

I also think it might be a good idea to just (if I have the time) audit a class I feel I wouldn't enjoy maybe a subject I think might be "boring" or just something I just
am not familliar with.

An area I belive I could improve with is, learning how to sift around a schedule. I had neglected getting any kind of planner since I learned of their existance, I disliked 
the idea of having my day neatly packed into the straight lines of paper. However, as I've picked up alot of new activites this I decided to give it a try recently, and I will
say I enjoy it so far. My entire being isn't written down on it, but it has unexpecticly become some kind of "idea book", I'll write down tasks for the day and see that it becomes
alot easyer to plan ahead.
